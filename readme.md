The **diact interactions** application is designed for the quantification of the pairwise direct, indirect, acyclic, cycling, and total (diact) interactions between any two sectors in the US economy based on the **system decomposition theory.** The interactive application can be reached at the link [here](https://www).

**The diact interactions:**

The direct and indirect impacts of economic factors, such as government spending, on the entire economy or on a specific sector had not been successfully quantified. This long-standing open problem has recently been effectively addressed by the system decomposition theory. The theory and associated methods also quantify pairwise direct, indirect, acyclic, cycling, and total (diact) demand interactions between sectors for the first time in literature. The theory, therefore, quantifies the diact demand distributions throughout the system induced by arbitrarily given final demands from sectors. As a result, the theory enables the quantification of the impacts of final demands on each sector, individually and separately, within the system.

This interactive application can be used, as examples, by policymakers to decide about the diact impacts of a government spending in terms of demand distributions it generates on the entire economy or on a particular sector of interest. It can also be used by business and financial analysts to determine the diact impacts of various factors such as personal and government consumption, investments, taxes, and exports on a particular industry of interest or the entire economy. More specifically, the diact impacts of an arbitrarily given final demand from, say the automotive industry, on the output of any individual industry in the car production chain, such as the steel industry, can precisely be quantified. As a matter of fact, the diact impacts of a given final demand individually and separately on all industries, and thus, on the entire system can be determined through this interactive application.

In summary, this interactive application makes the methods recently developed for the diact interactions and impact analyses publicly available to the policymakers and analysts for the first time. The users of this application are expected to know some fundamental economic concepts, such as supply and demand. The data needed for the app is annually published and obtained from the [Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the US](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?isuri=1&reqid=151&step=1).

**The system decomposition theory:** 

The system decomposition theory has recently been introduced for the holistic comprehensive analysis of nonlinear dynamic compartmental systems. The theory solves multiple long-standing open problems including the quantification of pairwise direct, indirect, cycling, acyclic, cycling, total (diact) interactions between any two compartments of the system. It enables tracking and back-tracing any arbitrary system flow and storage segment throughout the system, as well as their impact, decomposition, evolution, dispersion, and contraction. The system decomposition theory enhances the strength and extends the applicability of the state-of-the-art techniques and provides significant advancements in theory, methodology, and practicality.

The system decomposition theory enables the analysis of systems modelling real-world phenomena in multiple scientific fields. The theory and associated methods may prove useful, as examples, in quantitative systems pharmacology (pharmacometrics, drug development, PK/PD, ADME, drug metabolism and calibration, and exposure), biomedical and chemical systems (molecular interactions, metabolic networks, pathway analysis, and model reduction), epidemiology (population dynamics and infectious diseases), ecological systems (ecosystems ecology, food webs, and microecology), economic systems (supply, demand, production, consumption times, rates, and efficiencies, system responses, elasticities, price and growth indices, business cycles, sustainability based on input-output data), and data science (system structure, deep learning, and neural networks).
